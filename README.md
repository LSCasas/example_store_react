# Example Store App

> This project is part of my **frontend learning portfolio focused on React and Tailwind CSS**. 

A responsive store application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to log in, view a list of products, and access detailed views of each product. It demonstrates a complete login flow with form validation, protected routes, and toast notifications. The project integrates the API from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/) to simulate user authentication and manage product data. Built as a practice exercise, this app offers an example of how to implement a simple store with user authentication and product browsing functionality.

## How to Use This Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to :

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Authentication

### Login Process:

To log in, use the credentials of a sample user from the API â€” for example:

**Username:** `emilys`  
**Password:** `emilyspass`

If the credentials are incorrect, the app will show the following:

- A toast notification with the message: "Incorrect username or password."
- An inline error message within the form that says: "Invalid credentials."

### Security Note:

User session data is stored in `localStorage` for simplicity. In a production environment, this is not recommended due to security risks like `XSS attacks`. For better security, use `HttpOnly cookies` to store tokens. Since this is a portfolio project and not handling real sensitive data, these security measures are not fully implemented.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- npm
